    Zombie Scrapper is a twin-stick shooter that drops you right into the zombie
    apocalypse. You will battle hordes of zombies in destructible environments;
    not just your regular undead horde, but you'll have to outmaneuver fast
    zombies, out muscle big beefcake zombies, and make exploding zombies go 
    boom! All while scavenging whatever scrap you can get your hands on to 
    unlock a truly powerful arsenal of weapons, to keep your brains where 
    they belong!

    EPIC CAMPAIGN
    From solely trying to survive to stumbling your way into a secret facility
    and escaping it. There is a lot to experience in the 36 zombie-infested
    levels that you are thrown into.

    SURVIVE FOREVER
    If barely surviving the zombie apocalypse didn't leave a satisfying taste
    in your mouth. Test your survival skills and earned arsenal in 12 endless~
    survival levels to see how long you can really survive.

    OVERCOME THE HORDE
    No one ever survived without learning some new tricks! Train yourself
    with unique skills that will improve your movement speed, strength, and
    resourcefulness to hope that you can live another day.

    GEAR UP
    Take the fight to the zombies by unlocking 36 new takes on classic zombie
    fighting weaponry like fire axes, samurai swords, shotguns, and rifles.
    Collect enough scrap and the zombies won't know what hit them with weapons
    like the flame thrower, rocket launcher, and mini-gun.

    100%
     Master the game by completing all 14 achievements that will show off that
     you aren't someone to mess with once the dead walk this earth.

    KILL IN STYLE
    No one ever said you need to look like a scrub while fighting zombies.
    Customize your appearance with 12 different hats that range from super
    silly to outright rad.
